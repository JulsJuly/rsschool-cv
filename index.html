                    <p>Two years ago I became keen on creating websites. Due to lack of Web Development experiense, my first website was created with using of no-code platform.


                        However Web Development allows creat more complicated website structures according all needs and wishes.  That is why I decided to start my way learning Frontend Development. Creation of modern and efficient websites is my aim. 
                        
                        I'm sure my learning skills and desire will help me go through this way.</p>
